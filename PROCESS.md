# Day 1
Written proposal

# Day 2
Looking which map to use for visualisation (one with countrynames already included and with zoom)

# Day 3
Writing design document and thinking on how to read the data.

# Day 4
Working on the look of the website (css) and added a slider for selecting the year (without function till now)

# Day 5
Finishing prototype and having presentation.

# Day 6
Preparing data: looking how the data deals with changed / new countries ; translating countries to a country code (3 letters) ; filtering data (make new csv with only the data I need)

# Day 7
started typing function to draw graph of total incoming refugees: first ordering data (by country; by year). Looked up how to draw arcs on the map (seems pretty easy because it is possible to do that by countrycode).
