# Titel

-what problem will be solved for the user
Overview of where refugees are coming from and where they are going to.
-what features will be available to solve the problem
Interactive map
-an overview sketch of what the application will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out
Map with refugee-streams between countries. At every stream/country: detailed information and history
-what data sets and data sources will you need, how you will get the data into the right form for your app
Need data on numbers of refugees, where theyâ€™re from and where they go to. Sources: UN and similar. If there is irrelevant information, then first filter it out.
-what separate parts of the application can be defined (decomposing the problem) and how these should work together
*Map
*code that connects the numbers with the locations on the map
*code that draws flows between different countries (like flight routes from airplanes)
*code that opens a new window with detailed information and history about a refugee-stream / country together with a visualisation.
-what external components (APIs) you need to make certain features possible
I certainly need a map and I want to use d3 to make the visualisation.
-technical problems or limitations that could arise during development and what possibilities you have to overcome these
Zooming in on the map
-a review of similar applications or visualizations in terms of features and technical aspects (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)
(http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php) Refugee streams only regional. Other visualisations are bigger without the streams.
